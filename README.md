## What is WhyNoIPv6.com?
WhyNoIPv6.com is a specialized platform committed to monitoring and promoting the adoption of IPv6 among the 1 Million top-ranked websites and user-submitted campaigns. We offer insightful metrics to help you assess the current landscape of IPv6 implementation.

## Why is IPv6 Important?
IPv6 is not merely an upgrade; it's a fundamental pillar for the Internet's sustainable future. As we edge closer to exhausting the IPv4 address space, the immense address capacity of IPv6 becomes indispensable. Beyond the scalability, IPv6 brings along robust security protocols and superior performance, making it the linchpin for modern, efficient, and secure internet communications.

Failing to adopt IPv6 is tantamount to inhibiting the Internet's evolution. For top websites, this isn't just negligence—it's an abdication of their role as industry leaders. That's why our mission at WhyNoIPv6.com is not just to monitor, but to actively push for the closing of these alarming gaps in IPv6 adoption.

## How does WhyNoIPv6.com work?
At WhyNoIPv6.com, we meticulously scan each domain from Tranco's top-ranked list every 3 days to evaluate critical IPv6 adoption metrics. Specifically, we check for the existence of IPv6 DNS records and MX records. The data gleaned from these scans is then aggregated, analyzed, and made publicly available, providing a comprehensive and up-to-date snapshot of IPv6 implementation across influential websites.

## Tranco?
The [Tranco List](https://tranco-list.eu/) offers an alternative way to gauge a website's standing on the internet, diverging from traditional metrics such as those provided by Alexa rankings. Unlike Alexa, which ranks websites based on a combination of average daily visitors and pageviews over a three-month period, the Tranco List employs a robust methodology that aggregates data from various sources to compile its rankings.

This approach aims to provide a more comprehensive and reliable measure of a website's popularity and traffic, addressing some of the accuracy concerns associated with Alexa's data. As a result, the Tranco List is increasingly recognized as a valuable tool for understanding website prominence in a way that accounts for a broader spectrum of internet activity.

## Crawler
The crawler uses 1.1.1.1 as nameserver and will check for ipv6 records on domain.com, wwww.domain.com, ns and mx records.
It will check each domain every 3 days.

## Campaigns
In addition to displaying the IPv6 status of the top 1 million domains, WhyNoIPv6.com also has a campaign feature that encourages users to create their own lists of domains to check and shame. This feature allows users to generate their own personalized list of domains and monitor their IPv6 adoption progress. Users can also share their lists on social media to spread awareness about the importance of IPv6 adoption and encourage more websites to adopt IPv6. By empowering users to create their own lists, WhyNoIPv6.com aims to create a community-driven effort to promote IPv6 adoption and help build a more resilient and future-proof Internet.
